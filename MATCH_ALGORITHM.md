# Subtitle Matching Algorithm

## Overview

This document describes the sequential matching algorithm used in `whisper_srt/compare.py` to compare generated SRT subtitles with original text transcripts.

The algorithm uses a **best-match selection** approach: it calculates all possible match types and chooses the one with the highest similarity score, ensuring optimal matching accuracy.

---

## Algorithm Flow

```
For each original line:
  1. Skip if already matched (part of previous combined match)
  2. If no more SRT entries → mark as unmatched
  3. Calculate ALL possible match types:
     - Direct match (1:1)
     - Split match (1 original → N SRT)
     - Combined match (N original → 1 SRT)
     - Merged match (substring)
  4. Choose the BEST match (highest similarity)
  5. If no match found → try recovery strategies
  6. If still no match → mark as unmatched
```

---

## Match Types

### 1. **Exact Match (1:1)**

- **Definition**: One original line matches one SRT entry with ≥95% similarity
- **Example**:
  ```
  Original: "Hello, how are you?"
  SRT #5:   "Hello, how are you?"
  Similarity: 100%
  ```

### 2. **Partial Match (1:1)**

- **Definition**: One original line matches one SRT entry with 60-95% similarity
- **Example**:
  ```
  Original: "Hello, how are you doing?"
  SRT #5:   "Hello, how are you?"
  Similarity: 75%
  ```

### 3. **Split Match (1:N)**

- **Definition**: One original line is split across multiple consecutive SRT entries
- **Example**:
  ```
  Original: "Hello there, how are you doing today?"
  SRT #5:   "Hello there, how are you"
  SRT #6:   "doing today?"
  Similarity: 100% (when combined)
  ```

### 4. **Combined Match (N:1)**

- **Definition**: Multiple consecutive original lines match one SRT entry
- **Example**:
  ```
  Original Line 22: "There's a chance you two will be"
  Original Line 23: "in high school together."
  SRT #16:          "There's a chance you two will be in high school together."
  Similarity: 100% (when combined)
  ```

### 5. **Merged Match (N:1)**

- **Definition**: Original line is a substring of an SRT entry (other originals may also match)
- **Example**:
  ```
  Original Line 10: "Hello there"
  Original Line 11: "How are you?"
  SRT #5:           "Hello there. How are you? Nice day!"
  Both match as merged (substring detection)
  ```

### 6. **Recovered Match**

- **Definition**: Match found by looking ahead in SRT entries (out-of-sync recovery)
- **Example**:
  ```
  Original Line 50: "Let's go"
  SRT #100:         "Extra content"  ← Skip
  SRT #101:         "More extra"     ← Skip
  SRT #102:         "Let's go"       ← Match found! (recovered)
  ```

## Best-Match Selection Algorithm

### Step 1: Calculate All Candidates

For each original line at the current SRT position, calculate:

```python
candidates = []

# 1. Direct match (1:1)
direct_similarity = calculate_similarity(original, current_srt)
if direct_similarity >= threshold:
    candidates.append({
        'type': 'direct',
        'score': direct_similarity,
        'match_type': 'exact' if >= 0.95 else 'partial'
    })

# 2. Split match (1 original → N SRT)
for window_size in range(2, lookahead_window + 1):
    combined_srt = join(next N SRT entries)
    split_similarity = calculate_similarity(original, combined_srt)
    if split_similarity >= threshold:
        candidates.append({
            'type': 'split',
            'score': split_similarity,
            'window_size': window_size
        })

# 3. Combined match (N original → 1 SRT)
for combine_count in range(2, lookahead_window + 1):
    combined_original = join(next N original lines)
    combine_similarity = calculate_similarity(combined_original, current_srt)
    if combine_similarity >= threshold:
        candidates.append({
            'type': 'combined',
            'score': combine_similarity,
            'combine_count': combine_count
        })

# 4. Merged/substring match
if original_normalized in srt_normalized:
    candidates.append({
        'type': 'merged',
        'score': 0.75  # Lower priority
    })
```

### Step 2: Choose Best Candidate

```python
if candidates:
    # Sort by:
    # 1. Highest similarity score (primary)
    # 2. Prefer multi-line matches (tie-breaker)
    best = max(candidates, key=lambda x: (
        x['score'],
        1 if x['type'] in ['combined', 'split'] else 0
    ))

    # Execute the best match
    create_match_result(best)
    update_positions()
```

### Step 3: Recovery Strategies (If No Match Found)

If no candidates found, try recovery:

**Strategy A: Look Ahead in SRT**

```python
# Try matching with SRT entries ahead (skip 1-10 positions)
for skip in range(1, skip_ahead_window):
    future_srt = srt_entries[position + skip]
    if calculate_similarity(original, future_srt) >= threshold:
        # Found match ahead - skip intermediate SRT entries
        create_recovered_match()
        break
```

**Strategy B: Look Ahead in Original**

```python
# Check if future original lines match current SRT
for skip in range(1, skip_ahead_window):
    future_original = original_lines[index + skip]
    if calculate_similarity(future_original, current_srt) >= threshold:
        # Current original is missing - mark as unmatched
        # Don't advance SRT (it will match future original)
        break
```

**Strategy C: Consecutive Miss Counter**

```python
consecutive_misses += 1
if consecutive_misses >= 3:
    # Advance SRT position to prevent getting stuck
    srt_position += 1
    consecutive_misses = 0
```

---

## Similarity Calculation

### Algorithm

```python
def calculate_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:
    # 1. Normalize both texts (lowercase, remove punctuation)
    norm1 = normalize(text1)
    norm2 = normalize(text2)

    # 2. Exact match check
    if norm1 == norm2:
        return 1.0

    # 3. Containment check (substring)
    if norm1 in norm2 or norm2 in norm1:
        return len(shorter) / len(longer)

    # 4. Word-based similarity (Jaccard index)
    words1 = set(norm1.split())
    words2 = set(norm2.split())
    intersection = words1 & words2
    union = words1 | words2
    return len(intersection) / len(union)
```

### Examples

| Text 1                     | Text 2              | Similarity | Reason                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| "Hello world"              | "Hello world"       | 100%       | Exact match                        |
| "Hello world"              | "Hello world!"      | 100%       | Punctuation ignored                |
| "Hello"                    | "Hello world"       | 50%        | Containment: 5/10 chars            |
| "Hello there"              | "Hello world"       | 33%        | Jaccard: 1 common / 3 total words  |
| "I thought surprises were" | "That surprise was" | 36%        | Jaccard: 4 common / 11 total words |

---

## Position Tracking

### SRT Position Management

```python
srt_position = 0  # Current position in SRT entries

# Advance based on match type:
- Direct/Partial/Combined/Recovered: position += 1
- Split: position += N (number of SRT entries matched)
- Merged: position += 0 (don't advance, next original may also match)
```

### Original Line Skipping

```python
skip_next_originals = 0  # Lines to skip

# When combined match found:
skip_next_originals = combine_count - 1

# In next iterations:
if skip_next_originals > 0:
    skip_next_originals -= 1
    continue  # Skip this line (already matched)
```

### Matched SRT Tracking

```python
matched_srt_indices = set()  # Track which SRT entries matched

# Add to set when matched:
matched_srt_indices.add(srt_position)

# At end, find unmatched:
unmatched_srt = [
    srt_entries[i] for i in range(len(srt_entries))
    if i not in matched_srt_indices
]
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. **Split Original Lines**

```
Original:
  Line 22: "There's a chance you two will be"
  Line 23: "in high school together."

Generated:
  SRT #16: "There's a chance you two will be in high school together."

Solution: Combined match (N:1) with 100% similarity
```

### 2. **Split SRT Entries**

```
Original:
  Line 50: "Hello there, how are you doing today?"

Generated:
  SRT #20: "Hello there, how are you"
  SRT #21: "doing today?"

Solution: Split match (1:N) with 100% similarity
```

### 3. **Out-of-Sync Content**

```
Original:
  Line 100: "Let's go"

Generated:
  SRT #200: "Extra content"  ← Skip
  SRT #201: "More extra"     ← Skip
  SRT #202: "Let's go"       ← Recovered match

Solution: Look ahead in SRT, skip intermediate entries
```

### 4. **Missing Original Content**

```
Original:
  Line 50: "Missing line"    ← Mark as unmatched
  Line 51: "Hello there"     ← Matches current SRT

Generated:
  SRT #100: "Hello there"

Solution: Look ahead in original, detect missing line
```

### 5. **Large Missing Sections**

```
Original:
  Lines 100-110: All missing from SRT

Generated:
  SRT #200-210: Extra content

Solution: Consecutive miss counter (after 3 misses, advance SRT position)
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Why Best-Match Selection?**

**Problem**: Early returns can miss better matches

```
Original: "Okay, so it's taking Gabe a little bit longer"
SRT #29:  "Okay, so it's taken Gabe a little bit longer to get used to you."

Direct match: 60.00% → Would return immediately
Combined match: 68.42% → Never checked!
```

**Solution**: Calculate all candidates, choose highest similarity

```
Candidates:
- Direct: 60.00%
- Combined (with next line): 68.42% ← Best! Choose this
```

### 2. **Why Lower Score for Merged Matches?**

Merged/substring matches are less precise than exact matches. By assigning a lower score (0.75), we ensure that if a better match type exists, it will be chosen.

```
Original: "Hello"
SRT: "Hello there, how are you?"

Merged (substring): 75% score
vs
Direct (if next SRT is "Hello"): 100% score ← Better!
```

### 3. **Why Prefer Multi-Line Matches as Tie-Breaker?**

When scores are equal, multi-line matches (split/combined) are more informative than single-line matches because they show how sentences are being restructured.

```
Two candidates with 80% similarity:
- Direct match (1:1)
- Combined match (2:1) ← Prefer this (more informative)
```

### 4. **Why Track Matched SRT Indices?**

To identify "extra" content in generated SRT that doesn't match any original line. This helps detect:

- Hallucinations (Whisper generating non-existent content)
- Background noise transcribed as dialogue
- Misaligned content

---

## Limitations

### 1. **Transcription Errors**

The algorithm cannot match lines with significant word differences:

```
Original: "I thought surprises were supposed to be good."
SRT:      "That surprise was supposed to be good."
Similarity: 36% (below threshold)
```

This is a **genuine transcription error**, not an algorithm limitation.

### 2. **Very Short Phrases**

Short phrases like "Yeah", "Hi", "Out!" may match incorrectly due to high false positive rate.

### 3. **Threshold Sensitivity**

- **Too high** (>0.7): Misses valid matches with minor differences
- **Too low** (<0.5): Creates false positive matches
- **Recommended**: 0.6 (60%) balances precision and recall

### 4. **Word Order**

The algorithm uses word-based similarity (Jaccard index), which is **order-independent**:

```
"The cat sat on the mat" ≈ "The mat sat on the cat"
```

For most subtitle comparisons, this is acceptable since word order changes are rare.

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Phonetic Matching**

   - Use Soundex/Metaphone to catch similar-sounding words
   - Example: "surprises" ≈ "surprise", "were" ≈ "was"

2. **Edit Distance**

   - Use Levenshtein distance for character-level similarity
   - Better for catching typos and minor variations

3. **Semantic Similarity**

   - Use word embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT) for meaning-based matching
   - Example: "happy" ≈ "joyful", "car" ≈ "vehicle"

4. **Machine Learning**
